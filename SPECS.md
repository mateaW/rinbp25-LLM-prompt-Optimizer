# LLM Prompt Optimizer - Project Specification

## Overview

**LLM Prompt Optimizer** is a system that automatically improves prompts using **evolutionary algorithms**, leveraging a combination of data storage solutions and parallel execution environments. The system is designed for researchers, prompt engineers, and developers looking to experiment, track, and optimize prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently.

---

## Key Objectives

- Evolve and optimize prompts automatically using evolutionary strategies.
- Track relationships and modifications between prompts in a **graph database**.
- Store generations of prompts with a **key-value store** for fast access.
- Manage user accounts, permissions, and data access via **Supabase**.
- Execute prompt evaluations in **Daytona sandboxes**, ensuring safe and reproducible testing environments.
- Enable **workspace snapshots** and branching to maintain prompt lineage and support iterative experimentation.

## System Architecture

### 1. **Evolutionary Prompt Engine**
- **Mutation Functions**: Random word insertion/removal, synonym replacement, structure shifts.
- **Fitness Functions**: Model response metrics (accuracy, relevance, toxicity, coherence).
- **Selection Mechanism**: Tournament selection or roulette wheel.
- **Generational Flow**: Prompts evolve over multiple generations, with top performers advancing.

### 2. **Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j)**
- Nodes: Prompts
- Relationships: "Mutated from", "Derived from", "Branch of"
- Enables lineage tracking, branching, and comparison of prompt families.

### 3. **Key-Value Store (e.g., Redis or DynamoDB)**
- Stores generations of prompts with performance metadata.
- Fast retrieval of latest or highest-scoring generations.
- Can be used as a cache layer for rapid evaluation feedback.

### 4. **User Management via Supabase**
- Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based access control (Admin, User, Viewer)
- User-linked prompt experiments and saved workspaces

### 5. **Execution via Daytona Sandboxes**
- Each prompt variation runs in an isolated sandbox.
- Parallel execution with model endpoints (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs).
- Sandboxes provide consistent runtime environments.
- Workspace **snapshots** allow:
  - Saving state of a high-performing generation
  - Forking prompts into new experimental branches

- Add support for prompt chaining and CoT (Chain of Thought) prompts.
- Expand to support code generation and image generation prompts.
- Real-time collaboration mode (multi-user workspace editing).
